# This yaml file is read by ciscotest.rb to read
# device specific information before running unit tests

# Currently the only device specific info we support is
# an array of ethernet interfaces. More device specific
# attributes can be added in future.

default:
  nxapi:
    interfaces: [Ethernet1/1, Ethernet1/2, Ethernet1/3]

  grpc:
    interfaces: [GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1, GigabitEthernet0/0/0/2, GigabitEthernet0/0/0/3]
